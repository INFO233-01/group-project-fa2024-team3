What is needed:

•	Must import and use two modules at minimum - add one
•	Must handle errors - i.e wrong type, input is incorrect. Basically, I should not be able to crash your program simply by 
  using the program as it was designed - add better exception handling 
•	Must be unique code - You research how to do something, but the code must be your team's code. No Copying directly from 
  the research - dumb the code down
•	Optional for extra credit, declare a class and create objects with attributes and methods used in the code. - if needed

Next Steps:
Design code
Test code
add comments and note errors 
correct for errors
